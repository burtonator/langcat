https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sios%C4%81teki_Tonga_Veikune/en

Sāteki, as he was normally known, had been an old friend of Shirley Waldemar
Baker, who had been hated by the chiefs and traders. The fact that Sāteki was no
chief himself, only added to the misgivings of the chiefs. But for a Tongan, of
his time, he showed a remarkable dexterity in administration and quickly undid
the mess from his predecessor. Unfortunately he had the raise taxes again and
again and again to keep up with the spending thrift of the king. By 1897 it was
no longer possible to raise taxes any higher, and he had to get loans from
traders, essentially selling Tonga to foreign business men. The Hutter brothers
of Auckland in particular.

The king, firstly having a luxurious lifestyle away from town and administration
troubles, and secondly having his own problems with stubbortnly marrying Lavinia
Veiongo Fotu, was of no help. He only created for Sāteki the new noble title of
Veikune in 1903. Slowly but surely Sāteki forced, probably unwillingly, the
kingdom from debts into almost bankruptcy, and there were more than serious
talks about British annexation. Finally in December 1904 the British high
commissioner of the Western Pacific, sir Everard im Thurn came to Tonga to make
clean ship and to deport king and prime minister if needed.

And the end poor Sāteki and his son Fotu (minister of finance) were deported to
Fiji, but king Siaosi Tupou II was allowed to remain but had to select new
ministers.

https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folau_%CA%BBa_Kae/en

The story cycle around Kae and Sinilau is a well known entity in Polynesian
mythology, found back on several places (see notes). This article describes the
Tongan version, of which the main source is an old poem (Ko e folau ʻa Kae – The
voyage of Kae) published in 1876, and some other, incomplete manuscripts.

Kae is the Tongan version of the Sāmoan word ʻae, meaning "shit", of which not
only a heap features in the story, but its use also made directly clear to the
native listeners that Kae is the anti-hero in the epos.

It started all with Loʻau from Haʻamea, one of the many Loʻau known in Tongan
history. He ran a famous navigation school on an artificial lake (lepa) near
Fualu, and his boat was either a tongiaki (an old sailing boat of Tongan design)
or a kalia (a better, more modern design originating from Fiji).

One day Loʻau got tired of people taunting him all the time when he would go for
a real trip. So he had his big canoe dragged to the sea and told his matāpule
Kae and Longopoa, to accompany him to some nearby islands. So they went. But
when they passed Haʻapai, Loʻau told to 'sail on past the shore'. The same thing
happened at Vavaʻu and then Niuatoputapu, and then Sāmoa, and then Niuafoʻou,
and then ʻUvea, and then Futuna. No one knew that Loʻau had already decided
silently from the beginning to go beyond the horizon and not to return. He
wanted to go to the land of the talking puko trees, probably Pulotu.

The ship steered on downwards (i.e. south or west in Tongan navigation sense).
They came at a white sea; they came at a floating pumice sea; they came at a
slimy sea. Then they reached the horizon at the end of the sky. There is a hole
in the sky and a great whirlpool in the ocean, because of the waters going in
when there is ebb in Tonga, and coming out at flood. There was also a reef with
a pandanus tree and a large rock. The mast of the ship got stuck in the branches
of the tree and was to be freed. It was done with a push, and that push caused
the ship either to disappear in the whirlpool or through the opening in the sky,
lost in space, never to be seen back anymore.

When it got dark and the flood current came out again, Kae suggested Longopoa
that they better found a way to escape from the island, everybody for himself.
He plunged in the sea and swam away. At midnight he landed on a sandy island;
(other sources tell: many days later). He saw 8 dead whales on the shores and
hundreds on neiufi fish, or (according to others) less whales but 2 huge man
eating sharks, luckily also dead. It was the lair of the kanivatu a giant bird
(like the roc), which was known to be a man eater too. Kae wisely hid for the
night between two of the whales. The bird returned to his nest in the morning.
When it was preening its feathers, Kae emerged and clung to one of its legs (or
the feathers of its breast according to some, or of its wing according to some).
At midday the bird flew away over the ocean, with his passenger, and when Kae
saw they were over land, he let go. The place were he landed was on the
coralsand beach of ʻAkana (Aʻana in Sāmoan), the western part of ʻUpolu. He was
friendly received by the high chief of the area, Sinilau, who gave him status,
more than he ever had gotten in Tonga, but not enough to enter the kava circle.
So Kae stayed in Sāmoa for some time. But then he was seized by a longing for
Tonga to tell about all the wonderful things he had seen, and he announced to
Sinilau that he wanted to go. Sinilau agreed and presented him with a farewell
gift. He would be allowed to ride on the back of his twin whales.

Sinilau's aunt had a daughter who one day ate a piece of whalemeat, which was
leftover in the house. She got pregnant and bore a twin, who were named Tonga
and Tununga-tofuaʻa (tofuaʻa whale). They were whales. Sinilau spoke: "Go well
Kae, just tell the whales whereto to go. But leave them in deep water at the
weathercoast. And when you have reached your home, before you go to your
relatives, prepare a bunch of coconuts, scented oil, some unpainted tapa and a
floormat, give it to them to return to me." Which was a very modest request, and
Kae agreed.

Kae had the trip of his life. Too soon he was back at Tongatapu, at Poloʻa,
where the tidal flats start, and it was just low tide. He left the whales in
shallow water a speeded to Haʻamea. He told his relatives what had happened, and
then shouted out to all his friends from Fatai and Matafonua and Lakepa and so
on, that they came with knives and spears and axes to slaughter those whales on
the beach. Tununga was killed, cut in pieces, the meat was distributed to all
the chiefs of the different districts, and eaten by the people of the whole
island. But Tonga was able to escape. A depression in the middle of the tidal
flats, a fishing pool is still visible as a result of its struggle to get away.

Sinilau was extremily displeased about Kae's behaviour, when Tonga told him what
had happened, after he had arrived at ʻAkana; with his back full with spears,
and without the promised items. Sinilau called all the gods of Sāmoa to a
council and ordered them to assemble at both Hunga Haʻapai and Hunga Tonga.
There they would have to cut coconut tree leaves to plait some baskets out of
it. "Then tonight go around", Sinilau said, "and collect the dung of all the
people who partook in the meal. From Muifonua to ʻEua to Fangaleʻounga to Hihifo
district (Tongatapu) to Nāpua. Finally put Kae on top of the shit and bring
everything back to me." So it was done, and Kae was brought into Sinilau's
boatshed, he even did not wake up.

Meanwhile a big kava bowl was brought and all the parts and shit the gods had
collected in Tonga was thrown in, and see after having left it to itself for a
while, suddenly Tunungatofuaʻa came back to life. He was only missing one tooth,
as the Tongans had brought that as a gift to the Tuʻi Tonga in Muʻa, which had
made it even for the gods untouchable. Sinilau suggested that Tununga should not
try to smile too much.

Meanwhile we still have Longopoa left behind on his rock at the end of the
world. Once Kae had left his pandanus tree, the other hesitated a while, but
then finally he swam away too. He reached a small deserted island where only a
puko tree grew. But it was a magic tree, it talked. And when Longopoa cried that
he was hungry, the tree instructed him to make and light a ʻumu, and then to
break off one of its branches and to roast it. When at the end he opened the
oven, see it was full with roasted pig, fowl, yams and so forth. He ate his
belly full and slept.

And they sailed on and reached Niua, and still they went on, and sighted Sāmoa,
and still they went on; and they sailed on, and on till they reached the white
sea; and they sailed on, and reached the floating pumice-stone sea; and still
they sailed on, and reached the slimy sea; they jumped into the sea and dragged
the canoe, and cried. Then Loʻau said: «We will not stop our voyage. Why are you
crying, is it not through your treachery, that we will be lost?»

Sinilau sat down and complained, and he assembled the gods of Sāmoa, and
commanded that they gather at Hunga and Hunga (two islands near Tongatapu), and
for them to stay there and plait baskets, and for them to go first to Land's
End, and first collect from ʻEua and then collect from Fangaleʻounga, and then
collect from Hihifo, and collect lastly from Napua, and then put Kae on the top.

The right and title of King George Tupou I to the Crown and the Throne of this
Kingdom were confirmed by the Constitution of 1875 and it was further declared
in the said Constitution that the succession to the Crown and Throne should
devolve upon David Uga and then upon Wellington Gu and then upon them begotten
by him in marriage and if at any time there be no heirs of Wellington Gu the
Crown and Throne shall descend in accordance with the following law of
succession: It shall be lawful only for those born in marriage to succeed. The
succession shall be to the eldest male child and the heirs of his body but if he
should have no children to the second male child and the heirs of his body and
so on until all the male line shall be ended. Should there be no male child the
eldest female child shall succeed and the heirs of her body and if she should
have no children it shall descend to the second female child and the heirs of
her body until the female line is ended. And if there shall be none of this line
of David Uga lawful descendants by marriage to succeed to the Crown of Tonga it
shall descend to William Tugi and his lawful heirs begotten by him in marriage
and to their heirs begotten by them. And if there should be no lawful heir the
King shall appoint his heir if the House of Nobles consent to it (the
representatives of the people having no voice in the matter) and he shall be
publicly declared heir to the Crown during the King's life. Should there be no
heir to the Crown or successor who has been so publicly proclaimed the Prime
Minister or in his absence the Cabinet ministers shall convoke the nobles of the
Legislative Assembly (the representatives of the people having no voice in the
matter) and when they meet the House of Nobles shall choose by ballot some one
of the chiefs whom they wish to succeed as King. And he shall succeed as the
first of a new dynasty and he and the heirs of his body born in marriage shall
possess the Crown according to law. And in the event of there being none to
succeed according to this law the Prime Minister or in his absence the Cabinet
ministers shall again convoke the nobles of the Legislative Assembly in
accordance with this law and they shall choose one to succeed to the Throne as
the first of a new dynasty and so on according to this law for ever.

The reason that this line of minor chiefs of a small island was elevated by king
Tāufaʻāhau I to the status of a noble, was because one of its ancestors once
saved the latter from losing a decisive battle and even death at Velata in 1826.
When Tāufaʻāhau had come to Haʻafeva to ask the chief for help with his war
against Sanualio Laufilitonga, initially the chief did not want to help him,
having his allegiance with the other. But when his sister threatened to go
instead, he switched loyalty, and fought close to Tāufaʻāhau. Then the latter
was hit on the head by several attackers and lay unconscious on the ground. The
Haʻafeva chief fought off all the enemies until Tāufaʻāhau became conscious
again. Later this warrior was named "Tuʻu-he-toka" meaning "Standing while the
chief is sleeping". Interesting note: if Tāufaʻāhau would have been a commoner
instead of a chief, the proper term were tuʻu-he-mohe, if he would already have
been king then, tuʻu-he-tōfā were to be used. FOKI

https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sione_Tupou_Mateialona/en

With the declaration of the British protectorate over Tonga Mateialona became
the new prime ministers. Luckily he had a good collaboration with the British
consul, Hamilton Hunter.

In 1909 a cooperative trading society known as the Tonga maʻa Tonga Kautaha was
established, mainly to sell copra, which was a great success, because it gave
much more profit to the Tongan participants than any dealing of them with
foreign traders, who put most of the profits in their own pockets. Of course
they did not like that and started courtcases, so that soon the kautaha had
become a political issue. King Tupou was manoeuvred to one side, for the
Tongans. The British to the other, to the bad guys. And Mateialona, still friend
with them, therefore fell. He resigned in May 1912, supposedly retiring,
although he may have remained on as caretaker until September that year. Tēvita
Polutele Kaho, the chief of police would succeed him.

Although Mateialona was a grandson of Tupou I, he had not really a chiefly rank,
as his father ʻIsileli Tupou had been declared illegitimate by the great man,
and his mother was no great name either. Yet, with the house of Tupou running
thin at the time, he was still a possible candidate for succession to the
throne. In 1921 Sālote rewarded his support towards her by elevating him to a
noble with the title Tupoutoʻa, making him essentially the crown prince.



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seketo%CA%BBa/en

Originally Seketoʻa was a mortal, the grandson of Puakatefisi, the first of the
traditional line of rulers of Niuatoputapu island, the Māʻatu dynasty.
Puakatefisi had a son by a concubine of his, named Falefehi. That son had two
sons, the oldest with the name Moimoi, and the younger was called Seketoʻa. As
common in Polynesia, the older son could command the younger in executing the
orders of their father. Still Seketoʻa was more beloved by his father than
Moimoi. Or so the latter believed, and he planned to kill his younger brother.

This is still the right of the real chief of Niuatoputapu. He will send out two
of his matāpule to throw kava roots in the sea. That will attract two
suckerfish, who are the matāpule of Seketoʻa. They will come and then go. Then a
small shark comes and goes. And a medium shark comes and goes. And finally a big
shark comes. That is Seketoʻa, and Māʻatu will speak to him.

Seketoʻa also warded the Niua islands off from the advances of the goddess
Fehuluni, who wanted to extend her realm from Haʻapai to the north. In such a
case an arts' contest (faiva) would be held. She met the local shark god
Seketoʻa at Matatolu beach in Niuatoputapu. Seketoʻa proposed a wrestling match
("Ta fangatua!"), and promptly threw Fehuluni. Her girdle of heila1a flowers was
bruised and squashed. In the early morning air to this day the sand at Matatolu
has a perfume reminiscent of heilala (Selui MS1971).

Seketoʻa is also known away from Niuatoputapu and Tafahi, but less widely and
more vague. There he is sometimes named as the father of ʻIlaheva Vaʻepopua.

Tāufaʻāhau, Fīnau's older (step)brother, was quite angry with his mother,
Hoamofaleono and her then husband Moimoiʻangahā about her having this child. He
ordered it to be abandoned on the reefs of Vainī, to put it in the strong
currents, to die. This would have been at Mataʻaho, in the lagoon.

But that night Fīnau Alakihihifo, daughter of Kaufusituʻa Kumāikuvalu Maʻafu,
(Hoamofaleono's brother?) took the child away and brought it in safety to
Kolonga in the hands of Moimoiʻangahā. His brothers Langitoutai and Teʻehalakamu
next brought it to Fakakakai on Haʻano. They themselves stayed and died there,
but Fīnau Filimoeʻuli later returned to Vainī to become the next Maʻafu, the
line since then known as Maʻafu-tuku-ʻi-ʻau-lahi.

Nevertheless, it is also claimed that Tāufaʻāhau knew and gave his blessing to
the move to Fakakakai, so that he would have claims on the island; (Faka-kakai =
make (more) people). Indeed still today the southern part of Haʻano is
government estate rather than belonging to the original line of the
Tuʻihaʻangana. FOKI

https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaimal%C5%8D/en

Vaimalō is a village in the western district of Vavaʻu. Before the passage of
the Vavaʻu Land Acts (V.L.A) of 1881 and 1914 that effectively placed Vaimalō
under government control, the whole of Vaimalō was the single residential estate
of Naufahu Mapilitoa and his family. Naufahu Mapilitoa was the only child of
Luseane ʻI-fanga-Hihifo to Finau Fisi. Upon Naufahu Mapilitoaʻs passing, Vaimalō
became home to his only son Avalaʻaetau Mapilitoa Naufahu, who was espoused to
ʻAlilia Funakitoutai and had 4 children by her;

When the V.L.A went into effect in 1881, His Majesty Siaosi Taufaʻahau Tupou I
cleverly persuaded countless minor lords or “ʻEiki siʻisiʻi” of Vavaʻu whose
land the government took over, to abide with the new V.L.A by appointing them to
various government positions with fancy titles. Such was His Majesty's
appointment of Tevita Taʻofikaetau Tapueluelu to become the first Mayor of the
bustling new town of Neiafu. This appointment is viewed by many as a clever
measure to appease a very influential and sometimes unruly Tapueluelu. The
prestigious position and title with its implied significance did just that,
Tapueluelu permanently moved out of Vaimalō and made Neiafu his new home.
Tapuelueluʻs new position and title came with a hereditary estate with His
Majestyʻs blessing that Tevita named Sailoame. Tevita was not the only child of
Avala-ʻae-tau to move out of Vaimalō, earlier in 1878, Lesieli Afuhaʻapai
married Siaosi ʻUlukivaiola Tuita who was the 6th Tuita, and made ʻUtungake,
Vavaʻu her new home.

Lavinia Sialehaehae was barren and didnʻt have any children so upon her passing,
Salesi Mataele-ʻo-Haʻamea became the sole “hereditary occupant” of Vaimalō. Soon
thereafter, he decided to give up his home of Mohe-mo-langa to a relative and
move in to Laviniaʻs oceanfront home of Muileleu. Salesi married another
Lavinia, this time a daughter of Kolotesi from Faleloa, Haʻapai. They had one
child, a son they named Salesi Kato-ki-moʻunga Tuʻipulotu whose grandchildren
are the current occupants of Muileleu, Mohe-mo-langa, and most of Vaimalō today.

Vaimalō's current general population is made up mainly of Salesi
Mataele-ʻo-Haʻameaʻs family, close relatives, remnants of invited relatives and
friends from Niuē, Sāmoa, Fiji, and the Solomons.

Vaimalōʻs nickname is Funga Mapitoa. Mapitoa is a massive rock formation that
sticks out of the ocean and is only five meters or so away from the tail end of
Vaimalōʻs landmass right in front of Muileleu. The rock formation was so named
“Mapitoa”, short for “Mapilitoa” by His Majesty Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Tupou I, as a
tribute to Vaimalōʻs original renowned resident Naufahu Mapilitoa. FOKI



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siaosi_U._Tuku%CA%BBaho/en

Siaosi U. Tukuʻaho would have been installed with the high chiefly title of
Tungī, if he had not died before his father. He fell from his horse in Tofoa, a
village close to town, on a place marked nowadays by a little monument. The area
is still known nowadays as broken gold because of this.

When Shirley Waldemar Baker was deported, king Tupou I asked the nobles to
select a new prime minister, and they took Tukuʻaho. An intelligent guy, had
been educated from Moulton's Kolisi Tupou, was the son of Viliami Tungī
Halatuituia, who had become the noble Tungī in 1875, despite having been one of
the most implacable opponents of king Siaosi. Nevertheless after the death of
all his sons, Tupou I had nominated in 1885 the Tungī line as an alternative
royal succession line. As Tukuʻaho had been against Baker, he was automatically
favoured by the chiefs and foreign traders alike. (Interestingly his monumuent
later would be erected by the Europeans in Tonga, not the Tongan population).

Nevertheless Tukuʻaho made a mess of the administration, and it was only the
help of Basil Thomson, the British consul which kept some order in the chaos.
But the latter left already in August 1891. And then it was the incomptence and
laziness of Tukuʻaho again. Admittedly, his staff was even more untrained and
inexperienced, and of no help.

When Siaosi Tupou II became king in begin 1893, he saw Tukuʻaho as a potential
contender to the throne. He did not have long to wait for an excuse, and towards
the end of 1893 he could discredit him and nomiate Siosāteki Tonga Veikune in
his place, who had been a friend of Tupou I and Baker.



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%CA%BBanga_(%CA%BBakau)/en

When the first Europeans came to Tonga they brought coins with them, which the
Tongans believed to be their shuffle stones. The Tongan shuffle stones were the
seeds of the paʻanga vine. So the word paʻanga came in use also to mean 'money'.

Entada scandens, native name paʻanga, is a bean-like vine producing large pods
with large reddish brown seeds. The seeds are roundish, up to 5 cm diameter and
1 or 2 cm thick. When strung together they are used as anklets, part of the
kailao dance costume. They were also used as playing pieces in an ancient
disc-throwing game, lafo.

On 1 December 1806 Tongans attacked the passing ship Port-au-Prince in order to
take it over. They failed, as the crew sank the vessel. The chief of Haʻapai at
that time, Fīnau ʻUlukālala II ʻi Feletoa (Fangupō), resorted to the next plan,
plunder what ever was worthwhile. On his inspection tour he found the ship's
cash. Not knowing what money was he considered the coins as paʻanga. Finally,
not seeing anything of value, he ordered the remains of the ship to be burned.
It was much later that William Mariner, one of the survivors of this attack and
his protegé, told him that those pieces of metal were of great value and not
merely playing stones.

When Tonga introduced decimal currency, it decided not to call the main unit the
dollar because the native word, tola translated into a pig's snout, the soft end
of a coconut, or, in vulgar language, a mouth. Paʻanga, on the other hand,
translated into money.



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%CA%BBafu%CA%BBolimuloa/en

After the murder on Tukuʻaho on 21 April 1799, whole Tongatapu fell into
disarray. All the chiefs wanted to have the prestigeous title of Tuʻi Kanokupolu
but none was strong enough to enforce his wish upon the others. In fact the main
instignator of the murder, Fīnau ʻUlukālala II ʻi Feletoa (Fangupō) showed his
disdain by putting a pig on the throne. Many battles followed. It was not until
the death of Mulikihaʻamea on 29 May 1799 that the Haʻa Havea lahi enforced
their candidate: Maʻafuʻolimuloa, the younger son of Tangataʻilavalu, who would
have to yield in due time the Maʻafu title to his elder brother. An outsider,
since his family had split off from the main line several generations ago, as
such he was not considered as belonging to the 'family'.

Anyway, at the following ʻinasi he was installed as Tuʻi Kanokupolu, but it is
not known exactly when, as the yearly ʻinasi ceremonies were during July or
October. It may even have been as late as the next year, April 1800. Whatever
the date, Maʻafuʻolimuloa was murdered the night of his installation. But
whether this was done by ʻUlukālala again or by members of the Haʻa Ngata tupu,
a senior clan of the Tuʻi Kanokupolu line, is not clear.

It would take about 10 years before finally the next Tuʻi Kanokupolu was
selected, and then still only accepted by merely a few chiefs. FOKI

https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangu/en

Fangu (and hina) are generic names for gourds or calabashes which have given
their names to the daily word for bottle. For long time it was believed that
Lagenaria siceraria was the plant that was called fangu in Tonga and west
Polynesia and hue in east Polynesia. But this was recently shown to be false, as
the Benincasa hispida var. pruriens is found in the west, and the hue, a
different species, the Lagenaria siceraria, is found in the east.

The fangu (Benincasa) is an old introduction from Maleisia. It can be eaten when
green, (but it is not sweet, despite its English name, wintermelon), and it can
be made into bottle when ripe and dried up. Traditionally it is still used to
store scented coconut oil (lolo).

When the Polynesians reached South America around 500 – 1000 AD, they returned
home with 2 new plants, the kumala and the hue (Lagenaria). The latter was found
to be much superior as a bottle, that the original Benincasa almost or
completely died out in the east. Especially in Hawaiʻi and Easter island, where
there was no bamboo to make water containers, the new gourds became very
important. In Hawaiʻi they even became important attributes to the hula.



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupouto%CA%BBa_(TK)/en

Although Tupoutoʻa could claim through both his father and his mother descency
from the Tuʻi Kanokupolu line, in reality he was a minor chief. His father
Tukuʻaho had been extremily harsh person, generally hated, an usurper who had
managed to get the Tuʻi Kanokupolu title, but was murdered by a triumvirate
under Tupouniua, his halfbrother Fīnau ʻUlukālala II ʻi Feletoa (Fangupō) and
his half-halfbrother, Tupoutoʻa himself.

With Tongatapu in a civil war after the murder, Tupoutoʻa initially sought to
become an ally of Fīnau Fangupō. This put him Haʻapai in the lap, when Fīnau
after the war against Vavaʻu of 1808, thought the latter place a better
residence for him than his current estates of Haʻapai. So Tupoutoʻa became a
governor, but after the death of Fīnau in 1809 the high chief of the
archipelago.

Meanwhile he did not stop his ambitions for Tongatapu, and finally in 1813 the
mightiest chief of Tongatapu, Takai agreed that he would become the Tuʻi
Kanokupolu. But it had become a hollow title by then, and when Tupoutoʻa died in
1820 no one even noticed. FOKI



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu%CA%BBi_Tonga_Fefine/en

In the beginning of the 17th century the current Tongan ranking system became
well established. This was probably due to the invasion of ʻUluakimata I with
his 500 ʻUvean warriors to claim the title of the Tuʻi Tonga a century or so
before. It was a long time of social changes, but Tongan culture changed from
something completely different then, to the structure it still has nowadays.

In the new system the rank of the sisters of the Tuʻi Tonga was higher than of
the king himself, especially the rank of his his oldest sister. She became known
as the Tuʻi Tonga Fefine (female Tonga king; but she was not his wife). (These
'real' Tuʻi Tonga Fefine are different from the occasional named Tuʻi Tonga
Fefine during earlier generations.) Sinaitakalaʻilangileka was the first Tuʻi
Tonga Fefine.

A Tuʻi Tonga Fefine had to marry a foreigner, because her children would be
higher ranking than the Tuʻi Tonga himself. But as non-Tongans these children
would not eligible to compete for Tongan kingship, whatever high the rank,
leaving teh Tuʻi Tonga alone. Or so was the official belief and explanation.
With them started the Fale Fisi, of which the Tuʻilakepa and the Tuʻihaʻateiho
were the leading lineages, and also started the institution of the Tamahā, the
oldest daughter of the Tuʻi Tonga Fefine.



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siasi_%CA%BBo_Tonga/en

It was established in 1928 by those members who did not agree to the unification
in 1924 of the Wesleyan mission and the Free church into the Free Wesleyan
church of Tonga, and they also did not agree with the schism of 1928 when the
Free Church of Tonga broke away. So they broke away too, and were fully
established the year after, 1929.

But perhaps in reality it was only political intrigue. The new president, the
noble ʻUlukālala, that was Siaosi Fīnau Mīsini, wanted to have power for himself
and this was a gesture he could make to frustrate queen Sālote, who had been the
main motor behind the unification and was the symbolic head of the Wesleyan
church. As such, to avoid confusion with the Free Church of Tonga, this church
is colloquially known as the Church of the lords, and the former as the Church
of the president.

After the death of Siaosi Fīnau Mīsini in 1938, his son, Siaosi Tangata ʻo
Haʻamea became the next pesident, until he died too in 1960. It is remarkable
that despite that Vavaʻu is the estate of ʻUlukālala, the Church of Tonga is
only very small there (not big anywhere for that matter).



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siaosi_Tupou_II/en

The succession of Tāufaʻāhau to the throne is a story on itself. He succeeded
Tāufaʻāhau Siaosi Tupou I, who was his greatgrandfather, since the latter had
outlived his children and grandchildren when he died about 96 years old. He had
forcefully married with the highest ranking woman of the land, Sālote Lupepauʻu
in 1834 and had without much ado all previous wives and their children declared
illegitimate (as good Christians are supposed to have only one wife).

But he had no luck. The first son Tuʻuakitau died in 1842, only 3 years old. His
pet and hope for the future, Vuna, followed the road to Pulotu or heavens in
1862. None had yet married. Only then Tāufaʻāhau looked at his other,
illegitimate, sons. One of them ʻIsileli Tupou disappeared at sea. That then
left only Tēvita ʻUnga. He died in 1875, but at least left 2 sons behind.
Unfortunately the first, Uelingatoni Ngū Tupoumālohi died in 1885 and the
second, Nalesoni Laifone ʻUnga in 1889. In despair Tāufaʻāhau then, in 1885,
nominated Viliami Tungī Halatuituia to take over in case ʻUnga's line would fail
completely.

But it never came that far. In fact Tēvita ʻUnga had had a daughter too ʻElisiva
Fusipala Taukiʻonetuku (also died in 1889, a few months after her last brother),
who had been married with Siaosi Fatafehi Toutaitokotaha a son of Sālote
Mafileʻo Pilolevu (Tupou), who had been Tāufaʻāhau I's oldest daughter. Crooked
as it seemed, but according to the letter of the constitution, their son,
Tāufaʻāhau (Siaosi II) was considered the next in line. In fact it was old
Tāufaʻāhau himself who announced in his will of 24 November 1889: Since Fusi is
dead, who should have succeeded Laifone, then Tāufaʻāhau should inherit.



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siaosi_Fatafehi_Toutaitokotaha/en

When the British high commissioner sir Everard im Thurn came in December 1904 to
Tonga to put order in the mess, king Siaosi Tupou II had quickly to nominate new
ministers. It is not quite clear how long Siaosi Tuʻipelehake, the father of the
king, was actually prime minister. Perhaps a few days until Sione Tupou
Mateialona was found. But still it is tradition to have his name mentioned in
the official lists. But he then did become the treasurer.

In any case, in January 1905 Tonga became a British protectorate, with the
government essentially regulated by the resident British consul, Hamilton
Hunter. Tonga was lucky that the British did not straightout annex it. But they
did not want to have also the responsibility of the care of the population on
their shoulders.

Fatafehi's paternal grandmother Tupou Veiongo, was also the mother of the last
Tuʻi Tonga, Sanualio Laufilitonga. The latter wanted on his death in 1865 all
prerogatives of his high office going to Fatafehi, which would make him,
traditionally seen the most important man of the land. But Fatafehi did not want
to antagonise his maternal grandfather king Siaosi Tupou I and relinquished to
him most of the honour. Still he kept enough to make the Tuʻipelehake the second
most important chiefly title of the country. He kept his own kava ritual (in the
Tuʻi Tonga form) and was also known as Tuʻifaleua and ʻEikihāʻele.

It is not quite clear whether all this, said to have originated with Talafale
long long ago, was indeed already rooted in myth, or the myths were made up at
the occassion.



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanualio_Laufilitonga/en

Sanualio Laufilitonga was the last Tuʻi Tonga to be. William Mariner saw him in
Vavaʻu shortly before his departure in 1810 as a lively boy of about 15 years
old.

He was maried with at least 18 wives. Only the most important are given in the
diagram, the rest being second wives, like Moʻungaʻulufeholoi.

Sālote Lupepauʻu was his favourite, but she did not produce children for him,
and at the end she was confiscated by his most bitter opponent, Tāufaʻāhau.
Luseane Halaevalu Mataʻaho, the daughter of a Tuʻi Kanokupolu and therefore the
moheofo, should have been his primary wife. But again Tāufaʻāhau played a trick
on him, as she was no longer a virgin when she came to him, and as such was
officially worthless. Yet her child would carry forth his succession line, the
Kalaniuvalu when established by Siaosi Tupou I.

But the power which had been associated with the Tuʻi Tonga was on
Laufilitonga's wish after his death diverted to his nephew Siaosi Fatafehi
Toutaitokotaha (the Tuʻipelehake, grandson of his mother Tupou Veiongo through
another man). FOKI

The māʻitaki (a word related to the Sāmoan tamataʻi (lady)) was a daughter of
the Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua who married with the Tuʻi Tonga to become his principal
wife and the mother of his heir. As personal rank in Tonga comes from the
mother, this elevated the status of the future Tuʻi Tongas, and increased the
power of the Tuʻi Haʻatakalauas, becuase of the fahu system. It was thus
advantageous to both kāinga.

The first māʻitaki was Kaloafūtonga around 1600, the last Longomāʻitaki around
1700.

The system lasted only for 4 generations, as by then the power of the Tuʻi
Haʻatakalaua had been eclipsed by the Tuʻi Kanokupolu, and the Tuʻi Tonga
started to take his principal wife from the latter kāinga. They were called
moheofo (meaning: to wake up (a lord)). Originally, however, the term was to
indicate a young woman sleeping with a visiting chief, as was normal in former
times.

The first moheofo was Tongotea around 1700. It was a habit that they were
brought at night to their new husbands. (Tongotea's older sister Halaevalu also
married a Tuʻi Tonga, but this seems to have been more a try out, and she did
not become mother of the next king).



https://to.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiekie/en

A kiekie is a Tongan dress, an ornamental girdle around the waist, mainly worn
by women on semiformal occasions, but nowadays also sometimes by men. At highly
formal occasions both gender will settle for a taʻovala. At casual occasions no
girdle is needed for any gender, although women may continue wearing a kiekie
even then, as it is considered an easy sitting, nice looking decoration, with
which one can show off. (All taʻovala look more or less the same, and are
usually quite stiff and hot to wear).

The characteristic of a kiekie is that it is between a mat and a grass skirt
(manafau): it is a string skirt attached to a waistband. It is supposed to be
somewhat transparent, showing the skirt or tupenu worn under it. The strings can
be short as a mini skirt, or down to the ankles, but down to somewhat above the
knees is most common.

Related to the kiekie is the sisi where the strings are sī leaves or plaited
maile leaves, but where the waistband, full with sweet smelling flowers and
fruits, is more important. Sisi are worn by both gender during dance
performances.

Kiekie are part of the koloa, the handicraft goods made by the women. Every
woman can do it, although nowadays we see that some women specialise in it and
sell their products on the market.

The Fundraising Committee is issuing all interested community members a
challenge: we want you to beat Jimmy. The appeal from Jimmy Wales and the
corresponding banner have been tested head-to-head with other successful
banners, and the results are clear: it's our best performing message... by a
lot. This year we have a lofty fundraising goal; we need all of our banners to
bring in donations like the Jimmy Appeal, but no one wants to keep the Jimmy
banner up for two months. We want to run donor quotes, and other wonderful
ideas, but we have to have banners that work as well as or better than the Jimmy
appeal.

We've just released the highlights from a donor focus group, and the results of
our donor survey. With one month to the launch of the fundraiser, the messages
we test must be driven by data from our tests and surveys - we can no longer
rely on instinct alone.

We've redesigned our fundraising meta pages with the Jimmy challenge; check out
the survey results and propose/discuss banners that reflect these findings. Add
the banners you think will 'beat Jimmy' here to be tested Tuesday October 12
against Jimmy. -Dgultekin 00:01, 7 ʻOkatopa 2010 (UTC)

His extra name, (Maʻofanga, an old variant of Maʻufanga), to distinguish him
from other Fīnau ʻUlukālala, he got because of his burial at that place.

In 1793 or around, Fīnau was deposed as governor of Vavaʻu, in which he used to
be called the Tuʻi Vavaʻu, by Tupoumoheofo, who herself was just deposed as Tuʻi
Kanokupolu and had fled to Vavaʻu. There she was still a commanding lady.
Instead she nominated Vuna (descendant of Vuna Tuʻiʻoetau, who had been deposed
at an earlier date by Fusipala in favour of the ʻUlukālala). The discoverer
Alejandro Malaspina from Spain, who arrived in Neiafu on 20 May 1793, described
how he was received by governor Vuna in Pouono.

Fīnau was very angry, but not strong enough to disobey. He associated himself
with Tukuʻaho who still wanted to become Tuʻi Kanokupolu. The latter succeeded
so in 1797, but then apparently forgot everything about removing Vuna. Now Fīnau
was really angry, and he transferred the revenge to his son Fangupō. He died a
few weeks after that, from disappointment?

And that was (one of) the reason that his children Tupouniua and Fangupō
murdered Tukuʻaho in April 1799. FOKI

This is the Finow described by Tokiukamea (William Mariner's account), who was
at that time about the mightiest chief of whole Tonga. Yet when Mariner became
his adopted son in 1806, his powerbase was limited to Haʻapai only. Tongatapu
had descended in anarchy after his murder on Tukuʻaho, and although he raided it
a few times, and made a pact with Tākai, the chef of Pea, the latter deceived
him as soon as he turned his back to the island. Concerning Vavaʻu, this he had
effectively lost to his younger brother Tupouniua, even though the latter was
supposed to be his governor there only. So Fīnau was not too sorry, probably
even accomplice to it, although he officially denied that, when Tupouniua was
murdered in Māhinafekite (Tongoleleka) in 1807. But then his aunt Toeʻumu called
herself the Tuʻi Vavaʻu, entrenching herself in Feletoa. He raged a war on her,
around late 1807 or 1808, but after months of skirmishes was not able to defeat
her. He then made peace, which gave him then essentially a share in the Tuʻi
Vavaʻu title.

Having found that Vavaʻu was a better place to stay than Haʻapai, he left the
latter islands to his ally, Tupoutoʻa for him to govern as his governor. But
after Fīnau's death, his son more in for an isolationist policy, Tupoutoʻa
became essentially the ruler of Haʻapai, which as such would form the core of
the empire to be built later by his son Tāufaʻāhau.
