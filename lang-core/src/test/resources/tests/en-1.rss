It appears that Six Apart is going to buy  LiveJournal:

"Folks have been predicting a big year for mergers and acquisitions in 2005,

Apart, the parent company behind hosted blogging service TypePad, and Moveable

a mix of stock and cash, and could be announced sometime later this month,

<p>
Which seems like Six Apart will be investing more time in the hosted weblog
space.

</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.  Live Journal certainly
brings a lot of experience to the hosted blog space to the table but
acquisitions are hard.

</p>

<p>
Still I wish them the best of luck.  Maybe the fact that these are both smaller
companies will help out.

<p>
My gut tells me that the only reason this thing is working at <strong>all</strong> is that
they've spent a lot of money in QA.  It's amazing how much you can improve
garbage code with decent QA.

</p>

<p>
The issue is that this is a feedback loop.  SUN spends millions on their
proprietary development model, which results in horrible code.  They then spent
millions on QA.  Then they justify the fact that Java needs to be proprietary
based on their budget.

</p>

<p>
When the lights are off strange things happen.  Bugs thrive in this environment.
Be afraid.  Be <strong>very</strong> afraid!

Costello: Is Blog the publisher?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: Is Blog going to have the video too?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: And you don't know the fellows' names?

Abbott: Well I should.

Costello: Well then Blogs publishing the story?

Read the PDF  for more stats (man I hate PDF).

"27% of internet users say they read blogs, a 58% jump from the 17% who told us
they were blog readers in February. This means that by the end of 2004 32

It turns out that the only prediction I made in 2004 isn't going to come true.

I bet  that Dell would ship a version of Linux.  I doubt they will now.
Honestly they seemed like the leading candidate considering their entry into the
MP3 market at the time.

I still think that sooner or later someone is going to pull their head out of
the sand and realize how amazing Linux could be as a desktop.  All they have to
do is turn the OS into an appliance and bundle Open Office.  You'll then have a
niche somewhere between OSX and Windows.

There are still some fatal flaws here.  You can't go into Walmart and buy
software for Linux. Maybe this is the nail in the coffin.  I don't know.  Maybe
it will  ...

It turns out that the only prediction I made in 2004 isn't going to come true.

</p>

<p>
I <a href="http://saladwithsteve.com/2004/01/i-dont-think-dell-will-ship-linux-on.html">bet</a>  that Dell would ship a version of Linux.  I doubt they will now.
Honestly they seemed like the leading candidate considering their entry into the
MP3 market at the time.

</p>

<p>
I still think that sooner or later someone is going to pull their head out of
the sand and realize how amazing Linux could be as a desktop.  All they have to
do is turn the OS into an appliance and bundle Open Office.  You'll then have a
niche somewhere between OSX and Windows.

</p>

<p>
There are still some fatal flaws here.  You can't go into Walmart and buy
software for Linux. Maybe this is the nail in the coffin.  I don't know.  Maybe
it will only see consumer use in handhelds and smart phones.

My god this is disturbing :

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Bush administration is preparing plans for possible
lifetime detention of suspected terrorists, including hundreds whom the
government does not have enough evidence to charge in courts, The Washington
Post reported Sunday."

"Citing intelligence, defense and diplomatic officials, the newspaper said the
Pentagon (news - web sites) and the CIA (news - web sites) had asked the White
House to decide on a more permanent approach for those it would not set free
or turn over to courts at home or abroad."

... so all you have to do is be a "suspected" terrorist now and you can spend
the rest of your life in prison.

If you've been around the net for a while you've been subscribed to a few
thousand mailing lists.  I'm on a few big mailing lists now that host more than
a few thousand users.

Sooner or later some guy on the list will go on vacation and instead of just
letting email sit in their inbox he's nice enough to respond to all his email -
with a form letter!

Usually in the shape of:

"I'm on vacation.  I'll be back in January."

Of course they're stupid enough to apply this to *every* folder in their inbox
and so everytime someone posts or replies to the list this message is sent out
to one of every three thousand posters.

We don't care if you're on vacation.  We don't care when you get back and  ...

with a form letter!

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Of course they're stupid enough to apply this to <strong>every</strong> folder in their inbox
and so everytime someone posts or replies to the list this message is sent out
to one of every three thousand posters.

</p>

<p>
We don't care if you're on vacation.  We don't care when you get back and we
probably didn't expect a reply in the first place.

</p>

<p>
This is of course really annoying.  Certainly not the first time but when you're
on a list and 5-10 people are doing this and everytime you post you get
spammed... it's frustrating!  Being the disruptive Engineer than I am I though
of a fun little prank.

</p>

<p>
Send an email to <i>"joevacation@newbie.com"</i> with a messages of "Hey Joe!  Enjoy
your vacation" but use "joevacation@newbie.com" in the From and Reply-To
headers.

</p>

<p>
Any geek worth his salt knows what will happen next.

</p>

<p>
Joe's email client will start chasing its tail.  The message will come in for
joe.  Joe's email client will be nice enough to send off the spam reply.  This
message will then go to joe's inbox and the process will start all over again.

</p>

<p>
Send off enough of these emails and his box will go to 100% CPU and probably
crash.  Either that or the machine will run out of memory and constantly start
paging.

</p>

<p>
It could get worse.  If the client is stupid enough to include the CC headers
directly I could send the original mail with the header:

</p>

<pre><![CDATA[
CC: joevacation@newbie.com, joevacation@newbie.com, joevacation@newbie.co
]]></pre>

<p>
This would then cause Joe's email client to send off the message to everyone on
the CC list.  Within a few seconds Joe's client usage would grow exponentially
until the box was totally dead and couldn't send email fast enough.

</p>

<p>
I'm sure some mailing list clients are smart enough to handle this.  The
standard Unix apps would probably have no problem.  I'm sure they could be
defeated though.  You could use joevacation@x.x.x.x (IP notation) or use a
.forward file on another box.

</p>

<p>
Of course I'm just thinking out loud here.  There's no way I'd do this to a
random stranger.  I'm sure it was just an accident.

"About five years ago I started to notice an odd thing. The products that the
database vendors were building had less and less to do with what the customers

"It is this. Users of databases tend to ask for three very simple things:"

"1) Dynamic schema so that as the business model/description of goods or
   services changes and evolves, this evolution can be handled seamlessly in a

By the way, the inherent cost of the machines to do all this is relatively
negligible. Assume 3 by 400GB cheap disks per machine mounted in racks of 60
and one rack would pretty much do it if there wasn't a need for redundancy and
logs, say two racks to cover that. Companies are already coming out this year
with highly redundant disk arrays for $1 per GB or $1200 / machine for the
ones above (not counting the $1000 for the machine and memory itself). In
short, for 120 such machines, it will probably cost less than $500K and that's
less than 3-4 good programmers and it is one time a capital cost.

</p>

<p>
For the record - I agree.  the problem is that even if we <strong>solve</strong> this problem
we're left with a bigger one.

</p>

<p>
Lets assume for a second you have money necessary to purchase this hardware.
Now what?

</p>

<p>
How do you maintain the cluster?  How do you determine which disks in the
cluster have failed?  How do you get alerts when individual machines fail.?  How
do you maintain performance in the cluster?  How do you recover individual
databases and bring them in sync when they fail?  How do you detect power use of
the cluster?  How do you bring the entire cluster online again when is has a
critical failure.  How do you perform kernel upgrades across the entire cluster?

</p>

<p>
No... Whats not needed is LAMP.  What we need is CLAMP (Cluster-based Linux
Administration Management and Persistence).

</p>

<p>
The above issues can be solved with the correct design.  The major problem is
building an infrastructure so that you <strong>only</strong> need 3 developers and not a flock
of Systems Engineers constantly putting out fires.

</p>

<p>
We need a set of best practices.  We need a standard Open Source architecture so
that companies like <a href="http://flickr.com">Flick</a> , <a href="http://rojo.com">Rojo</a> , <a href="http://meetup.com">Meetup</a> , <a href="http://livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a> , etc can
focus on building their application and not worry about the scalability of their
site.

And she'd essentially have access to a new /alice directory where she can save

Here's a funny little trivia lesson for you Linux geeks!

</p>

<p>
Lets say you have a user alice and you want to give her access to /tmp/alice (a
place where she can keep tmp files).

</p>

<p>
You could just run the following commands as root:

</p>

<pre><![CDATA[

<p>
And she'd essentially have access to a new /alice directory where she can save
files.  For you non-Linux people out there this means give alice ownership of
the /alice directory and grant her read/write access.

</p>

<p>
Of couse this doesn't work.  Why not!?  We'll lets see.  It turns out that the
+x (execute) bit needs to be enabled!  Yes... EXECUTE!  When the execute
permission is applied to directories the semantic totally changes.  It now means
she can CHANGE to the directory.

</p>

<p>
Without this set Alice can't even list files in the directory.  The read bit is
just used to enumerate files.

</p>

<p>
It turns out there's a <strong>magic</strong> +X option in chmod which applies only to
directories.  The problem is that the standard umask doesn't support this as an
option so by DEFAULT there's no way to create a directory for users so that they
can access them. 

</p>

<p>
Fun.

There's a nice piece  on Bram in this months wired: 

"BitTorrent lets users quickly upload and download enormous amounts of data,
files that are hundreds or thousands of times bigger than a single MP3. Analysts
at CacheLogic, an Internet-traffic analysis firm in Cambridge, England, report
that BitTorrent traffic accounts for more than one-third of all data sent across
the Internet."

"If any one of them misses their favorite TV show, no worries. Surely someone
has posted it as a "torrent." As for movies, if you can find it at
Blockbuster, you can probably find it online somewhere - and use BitTorrent to
suck it down."

Which of course is why Bittorrent is so powerful.  This is the RIAA and  ...

Darren Barefoot takes Rojo to task ...

"I can kind of see what they're getting at, but I'm not sure it's the right
approach. Has the market demonstrated that it wants all-in-one info-sharing,
social networking solutions? I don't think so."

Rojo is the first service of its kind to integrate weblog aggregation
(info-sharing) and social networking - of course the market hasn't prove itself - 
the market is still growing!  The entire social networking, weblog
aggregation, and wiki space is going to be opening up wide this year.  We're
seeing a lot of new web services being deployed on an almost daily basis.

Their generalist predecessors--Friendster, Orkut, Tribe--were nifty to play
with, but are, practically speaking, utterly useless. You can find me on all
of the services (well, I canceled my Friendster account after this
incident--no great loss there), but I'm only active on the first three.  It
seems to me that Rojo is trying, needlessly, to be all things to all
people. The people don't want that.
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
The issue with Orkut, Tribe, Friendster, and the gang was that their entire
service was a <strong>feature</strong> not a product.  There's no <i>"there"</i> there.  The
difference is that Rojo is a weblog aggregator (like all the other dozen weblog
aggregators in the field) but also combines social networking to make sharing
information with fellow co-workers and bloggers *that* much easier.

</p>

<p>
<blockquote class="records-mode-quote">
# It's impossible, at a glance, to determine which items are from which from
which feeds. The feed name (more important than the item title, as far as I'm
concerned) is in a tiny font below the item title.
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
Do you have a better suggestion where to put it?  We've gone back and forth on
this one and landed on our current solution.  We're open minded and take a King
of the Mountain approach.

</p>

<p>
Theres also a thumbnail for the blog.  If you hover over the thumbnail you'll
see the title for the post.  None of Rojo's competitors have this feature.

</p>

<p>
<blockquote class="records-mode-quote">
# There's no indicator of read or unread. Or if there is one, it isn't nearly
  obvious enough.
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
An item is unread if its bold.  Normal font if you've read it.  Read and unread
status is very important to a lot of users and we're always trying to improve
this within Rojo.

</p>

<p>
<blockquote class="records-mode-quote">
# They only permit about 20 characters for a feed name, truncating longer ones
with ellipses. 20 characters isn't nearly enough. Dispense with the
nearly-unused right hand column and expand the left. Alternately, let me set
the width of each column. Bloglines may look kind of hokey, but I can drag the
frame edge to wherever I want it.
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
Yes... I don't like frames and I think Rojo's one page layout is nice. 

</p>

<p>
I do like the way <a href="http://a9.com">a9</a>  supports virtual columns which support drag.

</p>

<p>
<blockquote class="records-mode-quote">
# When I imported my OPML file, I got a message that 236 feeds were imported
successfully, and 20 failed. Check out this screenshot. There was no
indication of which 20 failed, or why. 90% isn't good enough, but how can I
fix the problem when they don't articulate the issue? Incidentally, I checked,
and my OPML file is valid.
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
I think thats a valid criticism.  We should probably consider a report after the
OPML has finished being imported.

</p>

<p>
Thanks for the feedback!

<p>
Of course this all started when Steve <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/index.php?p=26">noticed</a>  that Rojo wasn't including the
correct link to the NYTimes stories.

</p>

<p>
I thought I would take a moment and explain what was happening from a technical
perspective. 

</p>

<p>
Rojo was finding and indexing the RSS just fine but was using the GUID instead
of the correct 'link' element as per the RSS 2.0 spec.

</p>

<pre><![CDATA[
<guid isPermaLink="false">
http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29mongolia.html
</guid>
]]></pre>

<p>
Of course this GUID isn't a permalink so Rojo shouldn't have been showing it to
the user.

</p>

<p>
The NYTimes wants aggregators to use this link instead:

</p>

<pre><![CDATA[

<link>
http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/29/business/worldbusiness/29mongolia.html?ex=1261976400&en=1bfa8a21f3e9dcac&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt
</link>

]]></pre>

<p>
... and was even nice enough to include the <code>partner=rssnyt</code> which I think
is that made all the difference.

Today I played with using TSocks  and SSH to provide a transparent SOCKS5
proxy to internal hosts in our colo.

Its a pretty easy setup:

{{{

apt-get install tsocks
vi /etc/tsocks.conf #define your networks here
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtsocks.so

ssh -D 9050 username@server.com

}}}

Then you can use all your standard applictions like wget, Mozilla, etc without
any reconfiguration.  Since its SOCKS based and not application based you can
connect to everything as if you had a route.  No more stupid localhost:198377
custom port forwards!

The trick of course is the {{{-D 9050}}} which tells SSH to open a SOCKS server
on that port.

It turns out that tor  also supports tsocks which seems ...

hsqldb .

"One noteworthy addition to this upcoming 2.0 OO.o release is the HSQL Embedded

everyone by beating IBM's Cloudscape (now also open sourced) and even C++

"OpenOffice Base" which allows you to effortlessly create both databases,

<p>
This is NOT news.  These performance stats were done <strong>years</strong> ago by the original
author of Hypersonic (not hsqldb) and were created while we were working on the
fork of the project named <a href="http://axion.tigris.org/">Axion</a> .

</p>

<p>
Hsqldb is a terrible database.  The authors and maintainers of the projects in
my experience have done a poor job at maintaining the project.  This is why I
participated in the fork (Axion).

</p>

<p>
Of course <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/derby.html">Derby</a>  looks like its going to come out and really suprise everyone
and I can't wait to play with it.  Its a shame Open Office didn't use this
database instead.

Open post!  What do you want in your RSS/Atom aggregator that doesn't exist
today or hasn't not done correctly?

Better recommendations?  

Offline reading support?

Better transparent browser integration?

Better performance?

Better threading support? 

Ability to aggregate comments?

Support for media integration?

Of course the best ideas might end up implemented in Rojo .

Just add your thoughts to the comments...
